I've created a fully functional MVP for your Emoji Town pack opening system! Here's what I've implemented:
âœ¨ Current Features
Pack Opening System:

Beautiful animated pack opening with 10x10 grid (100 emojis)
Guaranteed distribution matching your specs
Staggered reveal animation for excitement
Collection tracking with counts and "new" badges

Collection Management:

Organized by categories (People, Skin Tones, Professions, Wildcards, Objects)
Visual count badges for duplicates
Hover effects and smooth animations
Statistics tracking

ZWJ Preview:

Shows example combinations that will be possible in Phase 2
Demonstrates the technical foundation

ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Guide
For your developer, here's the critical ZWJ implementation strategy:
1. Unicode ZWJ Database Integration
javascript// Fetch official Unicode ZWJ sequences
async function loadZWJDatabase() {
    const response = await fetch('https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/latest/emoji-zwj-sequences.txt');
    const data = await response.text();
    return parseZWJSequences(data);
}
2. ZWJ Combination Engine
javascriptfunction attemptZWJCombination(components) {
    // Convert components to Unicode codepoints
    const sequence = components.map(emoji => [...emoji].map(char => 
        char.codePointAt(0).toString(16).toUpperCase()
    )).join(' 200D '); // 200D is ZWJ character
    
    // Check against loaded database
    return isValidZWJSequence(sequence) ? renderSequence(sequence) : null;
}
3. Critical Technical Notes

Don't generate combinations - validate against Unicode standard
Handle fallbacks - not all combinations work on all devices
Use proper Unicode handling - emoji are multi-codepoint sequences
Test on multiple platforms - iOS, Android, and web render differently

ðŸŽ® Game Mechanics Ready for Phase 2
The current system perfectly sets up for town building:

Players already understand collecting components
The pack opening creates anticipation and investment
Collection categories map directly to ZWJ combination types
Statistics provide progression feedback

ðŸš€ Next Development Steps

Implement ZWJ Engine using the Unicode database approach
Add Town Grid with drag-and-drop placement
Create Combination UI where players attempt ZWJ sequences
Add Success Feedback when valid combinations are created
Implement Progression with new pack types and rarer emojis

The MVP demonstrates the core loop and proves the concept works. Players will love the pack opening dopamine hit combined with the creative ZWJ combination system!
