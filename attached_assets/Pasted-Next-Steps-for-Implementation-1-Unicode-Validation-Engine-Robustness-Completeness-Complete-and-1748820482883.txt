Next Steps for Implementation
1. Unicode Validation Engine: Robustness & Completeness
Complete and lock the RGI/Unicode lookup tables, making sure all sequence varieties (families, skin tones, professions) you want in-game are present. (Automate validation using the spec’s latest emoji-test.txt.)
Edge case handler: Ensure invalid/mixed/mis-ordered ZWJ combinations fail gracefully, with actionable error messaging.
Test Suite: Expand unit/integration tests to force all types of failure: invalid skin + person, bad family combos, unsupported browsers, etc.
2. Entity/State Machine Robustness
Atomicity Layer: Ensure every phase transition and every combinatorial action (family creation, placement, adoption, etc.) is atomic (commit/rollback).
Statistical Validator: Implement post-phase and pre-advance checks so phase transitions only occur if statically/structurally valid—no shortcuts, no exceptions.
3. Data Model Finalization
Formalize schemas for every core entity (Emoji, Citizen, Family, Building, Relationship) with strict typing/enums for valid types/states.
Relationship tracking: Prepare for extended family and professional/civic ties.
4. UX & Accessibility Expansion
Alt text: Ensure dynamic construction of alt text/aria-label for any ZWJ or family emoji, describing its contents/structure.
Render fallback: For unsupported emoji, ensure a fallback UI with explanation.
ARIA roles: Validate and patch all tab/focus/reader flows.
5. Cross-Platform/Font Handling
Font detection: Add robust handling for missing emoji fonts—warn user with guidance.
Rendering test harness: Continuously validate output on all listed browser/OS combos.
Progressive enhancement: Add non-blocking polyfills/fallbacks if modern browser not present.
6. Advanced Validation (For Future Extension/Testing)
Import/export: When handling game saves/imports, revalidate every emoji entity for RGI compliance before restoring.
Unicode upgrades: Set up a procedure to auto-import/test new Unicode releases.
7. Performance/Scalability Auditing
Stress test with N=1000+ citizen towns.
Profiling: Time validation/sequence rendering for possible bottlenecks.
Optimize memoization/caching of common sequence lookups and ZWJ rendering.
8. Documentation and Developer Onboarding
Expand docs for every shared module, validation rule, and data pipeline.
Error catalog: Explicit mapping between validation failure codes/messages and remedial UX.
Contributing guide: Explicit listing of Unicode validation expectations for new emoji/features.
Sequence of Work (Recommended Order)
Lock Unicode/RGI data inputs, test validation engine exhaustively.
Finalize and type all core entities/game state transitions.
Implement and test all five phase flows with atomic commit/rollback.
Harden error handling, user suggestions, and fallback rendering.
Deepen accessibility and ARIA coverage.
Stress test, profile, and optimize as needed.
Prepare for future Unicode updates/migration.
Your Role as LLM Coding Assistant
Maintain vigilance on Unicode/RGI compliance at every code boundary.
Never allow code or logic to diverge from the Unicode spec—always reference up-to-date standards.
Insist on atomic state changes and cross-phase integrity.
Proactively suggest test cases for ALL failure modes, not just valid paths.
Ensure documentation, accessibility, and error feedback keep pace with systems evolution.
Be the "spec lawyer" and "integration tester" for every emoji, ZWJ rule, and entity link.
